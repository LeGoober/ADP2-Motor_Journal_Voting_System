CREATING A PROJECT FOR THE CLIENT VOTING SYSTEM
================================================================================
I think when working with a large project like this keeping notes and code documentation as well as
a list of all the possible methods of doing things in each class will be crucial so I need to focus
on separating the components of the entire Client component into its two main functionalities:
    ->Creating the Graphical User Interface that we will use to then ensure we are able to create
    the methods and components that will capture our user input;
    ->The Client Network portion will facilitate the fact that we are able to pass in the values 
    from the GUI into the Server via the Streams that are connecting it and the server, so we will 
    work on this shortly;
